## Summary 

This is an application that uses Express routes to access an SQL database which contains information about an inventory of products and their categories and tags. The routes allow the user to view the current tables using GET routes, add entries to the tables using POST routes, update current entries using PUT routes, and delete entries using DELETE routes.

## Installation

Clone this repository on your computer. Once you are in the correct folder on your terminal, run `npm i`. Once this is done, enter into your MySQL shell and run the command `SOURCE db/schema.sql` to make sure that your database is created and/or empty. Next, go to the .env file and replace the credentials there with your own.

## Testing 

These routes can be tested using Insomnia. Here is a link to a video demonstrating the installation and testing process: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/R5Lmyth9tFe1XqSRrcVa
